		<h2>
	  	  Project name: CoolWatch (2023)
		</h2>
		<h4>
	  	  Explanation: A cooling bracelet that helps you cool down before and while sleeping during warm summer days. 
		</h4>
		<h4>
		  Category: UX, researching experiences
		</h4>
		<br>
	  	<b>
			Situation
		</b>
			<p>
			Summers are getting warmer, i.e. climate change, and electricity bills are rising. The focus of the project was to analyse, design and evaluate UX.
			</p>
		<b>
			Task
		</b>
		  	<p>
			The aim was to solve the frustration that users are experiencing around the warmth in their bedrooms while decreasing the use of electricity and the pressure on the climate. In short, the project revolved around “more by less, creating positive thermal experiences”. To evaluate UX, all methods used targeted a different part of Norman’s UX design theory (2004), i.e. reflective, behavioural, and visceral perspectives.
			</p>
		<b>
			Action
		</b>
		  	<p>
			To assess the behavioural and visceral level of the product, controlled observation and usability testing were used. The first experiment consisted of a cooling element placed against the participant’s wrist and a ‘hotbox’ in which the participants had to take place. In the second experiment, the participants were given a mock-up to test and shown renders of the final product. A semantic scale and AttrakDiff were used to assess the reflective level. The participants were questioned during the experiments with an emphasis on emotions.
		</p>
		<b>
			Result
		</b>
		  	<p>
			The results show that the UX goals had been met. Including that the product should give the user control over their situation, comfort in their bed, and convenience of using the product. In addition, the results have helped to further tie in the Norman theory and, in combination with the Attrak- Diff, gave us a broad perspective of the overall experience.
			</p>
		<b>
			Reflection
		</b>
		  	<p>
			The scales have also showcased some areas that could be further investigated to deliver an even better user experience. Foremost, from a reflective point of view. For example, different prototypes would be needed to evaluate the product's physical attributes. The prototype would aim to assess e.g. material, shape, and tactility of the product. A functional model that could be used in the actual context should also be created which could be worn by a user during a night’s sleep on a hot summer day. This would allow assessment of the functionality and how the users would experience the product in its intended situation.
