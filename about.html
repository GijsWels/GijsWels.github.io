		  Hi, this is me.. 
			<br><br>
	  	  I am Gijs, an Industrial Design Engineer with an interest in good design and innovation. During my education I learned that it is not only important to dream, but also to realize. This results in a hardworking person who motivates those around him to achieve the same goals - to make things happen.
			<br><br>
	  	  I was born in 1997 in Rotterdam. After finishing my high school I started at the Technical University of Delft where I have been educated in Industrial Design Engineering with a specialisation in Integrated Product Design. As an IPD graduate in spe I see myself as an all-round designer with a specific interest in furniture design. My character as a designer is best explained in my educational journey. Since I started off as an IDE student I have done a Minor in Architecture and an internship in UX/UI and development. During my IPD Master programme I have also studied at Chalmers university in Gothenburg, Sweden. There I have dived into UX, Form, Manufacturing, and Management.
			<br><br>
	  	  Take a look around on my website. Several projects, which I am proud of, can be found under the header "Portfolio" or on the home page.
